This wasn’t particularly insightful of me&#8202;—&#8202;the company had already launched two small pilots (UberEssentials and UberFresh) in the Fall of 2014. But in January 2015, Uber <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/01/26/uber-cancels-on-demand-delivery-service-pilot-uberessentials/" data-href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/01/26/uber-cancels-on-demand-delivery-service-pilot-uberessentials/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">killed UberEssentials</a>, and for months, there was no expansion of either service. So was I wrong? Nope. In April 2015, Uber launched UberEats in four markets (since grown to a dozen), and this past October, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-rush-fedex-killer-released-2015-10" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-rush-fedex-killer-released-2015-10" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">Uber launched Uber Rush</a> in three major US cities.

And again, it was a pretty safe bet that the company would be the talk of tech and culture throughout 2015. A major proof, to my mind, was Rachel Whetstone’s decampment from head of Google comms to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/14/rachel-whetstone-quits-google-role-join-uber-stock-exchange" data-href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/14/rachel-whetstone-quits-google-role-join-uber-stock-exchange" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">take a similar role at Uber</a> this past May.

But plenty of others believe Apple’s foray into wearables was a disappointment. Apple doesn’t break out units shipped for its watches (a strong sign the company is itself disappointed), and estimates range from a low of single digit millions to a high of nearly 20 million.

And while the public adtech stocks are still battered, I think I got this one right as well.

Overall, I think the world is going to figure out that adtech is about more than ads&#8202;—&#8202;it’s about creating an open, accessible processing and notification layer for the entire Internet. In 2015, adtech was definitely back.</p><p name="1995" id="1995" class="graf--p graf-after--p">So overall, how’d I do? Well, by my count, I got seven right and two half right, and whiffed on three.

I guess I’ll try again in a week or so. Till then, thanks for reading in 2015.

The air above her head flickered in midnight blues and charcoal grays. Several massive orange puffs behind her cast dark shadows over the table top. The two worms and fat fly she addressed were silent, surprised at her sudden entrance. Her companions, the grizzled earwigs and their subservient silverfish, stood waiting.</p><p name="f720" id="f720" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Inside the house, scavengers who came upon each other without predatory intent could expect inquisitive and jovial interaction. Flies, crude and blunt as they are, didn’t do so well with the jovial part. Donny would normally start with an insult, then move into a rant based on the incoming species’ stereotypes. This time however, he was silent, brow visibly furled due to cognitive overload. How could he get rid of the newcomers and control his hostage situation?</p><p name="843f" id="843f" class="graf--p graf-after--p">One of the hostages broke the silence. Norm spoke, “uh, you’ve had poppycock dust before?”</p><p name="40bd" id="40bd" class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You’re diggity darn right I have, and I’m willing to purchase some off you this very moment.” As she finished her sentence, the mosquito shot a sly wink in Norm’s direction. Luckily, he caught it. “But, I’ll only take it if it’s genuine. Don’t you slip me dust from a honeycrisp or granny apple. I won’t take any of that second rate stuff.”</p><p name="3235" id="3235" class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It’s real alright. You can come see for yourself, we were just about to go get the seeds,” Norm cautiously replied.</p><p name="326b" id="326b" class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Well alright then, me and my boys here will join you on your trek. Let’s giddy on up.”</p><p name="93e9" id="93e9" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Donny’s brow furled to right angles. He started, “Wait just a minute now plasma-sucker.” The mosquito didn’t flinch at the insult. Among the group, adrenaline was rising and the air was as heavy as the sweat dripping down Donny’s antenna. Using all of his brain power to craft his next sentence, he continued, “I’m sorry to inform you that these two worms and myself have an agreement to tend to. We won’t be going nowhere for the time being.”</p><p name="f6c1" id="f6c1" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Turning to face the fly, the top-hatted mosquito responded, “Oh, pardon me. I got all worked up over the thought of poppycock dust and I forgot my manners.” At this comment, she audibly clicked two segments in her lower abdomen. Moving behind Donny, the earwigs stealthily unhooked the silverfish, though keeping them put. She continued, “I didn’t invite the fly on our trek. Will you join us?”</p><p name="27f2" id="27f2" class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Will I join you?” Donny’s voice cracked. “I’m not going anywhere. And… and neither are the worms. As I said, we were in the middle of something, an agreement of sorts.”</p><p name="1e34" id="1e34" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Donny was shaking with adrenaline and anxiety. The mosquito paused, then calmly replied, “Now I’m real sorry about this friend, but it seems to me that these worms don’t want much to do with your agreement,” she said and looked to Norm and Norman.</p><p name="d0c3" id="d0c3" class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Nope!” spouted Norman.</p><p name="2261" id="2261" class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“And we can’t just pass up an opportunity for poppycock dust. It sounds like you’ll be staying, and we’ll be taking the worms and going. Don’t make a fuss now, shit-eater.” She turned to leave, motioning that the worms come with.</p><p name="4d7a" id="4d7a" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Donny felt the insult, registered his loss of control, and lunged to attack. At the very moment of lift off, two lashes swung around his thorax and abdomen. The lashes quickly tightened, rendering his wings motionless and causing his paralyzed body to nose-dive from the air. He hit face first, feeling something in his proboscis crack as orange spatter spewed onto the table top.</p>', '2015-07-22', 1),
